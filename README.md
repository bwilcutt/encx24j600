# encx24j600
Driver for Linux - ENCX24J600 Ethernet Chip

This repository contains a working encX24J600 Microchip ethernet driver.  The J800 exists elsewhere on the net but is not compatible
to the 600.  To include this driver, build it as a device driver or include it in the Kconfig of your Linux distro.

It is fully tested and working.
